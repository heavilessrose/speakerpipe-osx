This is an early release of "speakerpipe" and "mikepipe", two audio tools for Mac OS X.

The primary reason for release is to make life a little easier for CoreAudio framework users. The audiopipein and audiopipeout objects make it much easier to do simple audio work than does the CoreAudio framework.

The CoreAudio framework runs a callback in another thread to get samples to send to the speaker and to post data from the microphone. This is much more difficult than usual on UNIX, where doing simple things with audio means just dumping bytes down a pipe to play, or reading from a pipe to record. The functions simulate that, and the command-line tools show an example of usage.

Example:
--------

$ ./mikepipe > record.example

(interrupt with control-C)

$ ./speakerpipe < record.example

You should hear back what you just recorded.

usage: speakerpipe [-v] [-c channelCount (1 or 2)] [-s|-u|-f] [-b|-w|-l] [-x] [-r rate]
 -v : show version and exit
 -s : signed samples
 -u : unsigned
 -f : float
 -b : 1 byte per sample
 -w : 2 bytes per sample
 -l : 4 bytes per sample
 -x : use opposite endian
 -r : sample rate, defaults to 44.1 kHz

mikepipe uses similar options.
